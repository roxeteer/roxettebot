You build it up and tear it down
There’s no reason to follow you
You left the song without a sound
You left the story I made for you
Softly angels bow and cry
In the stillness of the night
Never is a long time – goodbye
No answers for the asking
It’s a long time – goodbye
No mercy for the aching
It’s a long time
Oh I see no light on the forsaken
Never is a long time – goodbye
Let’s spend the night when this dream
Has come to an end
Sometimes you laugh sometimes you cry
And yes I’ve cried over you
You’ve left me blind in paradise
You’ve left me hungering for the touch of you
Snow white angels run and hide
In the blackness of the night
Never is a long time – goodbye
No answers for the asking
It’s a long time – goodbye
No mercy for the aching
It’s a long time
Oh I see no light on the forsaken
Never is a long time – goodbye
Let’s spend the night when this dream
Has come to an end
