I’ve got a hot chilly feeling I don’t understand
I’ve got to run through this minute like a hurricane
I’ve got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul
I find my back to the wall when it’s time to go
I’ve got to know is that your heartbeat?
Paint…me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I I’m the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
I get a love shock/electric from the touch of your hand
I’m getting lost in the riddles of the modern man
I’ve got it up down all around tied to the bone
Hey there’s a strange situation on the late night show
I’ve got to know is that your heartbeat?
Paint…me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I I’m the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
Do it right
I can feel the woman in me tonight
Oh I I’m the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
