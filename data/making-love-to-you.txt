There was a night to say
Something to cherish on a rainy day
If I close my eyes and go blind
I’m in the middle of the rush rush
Making love to you
Is all I ever wanted to do
And I leave the world behind
I laugh at all the things I’ve done for you
If there was a dream to say
I’m in the middle of a rush rush
Making love to you
Is all I ever wanted to do
Making love
Making love to you
Making love
Making love to you
Your love is so sweet to recall
The greatest of them all
I’m easy on my knees for you
Making love to you
I couldn’t love you
Anymore than I do
God knows
It’s all I ever wanted to do
All I ever wanted to do
