Living here without you is not an easy way of life
I spend my time without you
I try to make it all worthwhile
Standing in a rainfull coming down from the sky
Why should I cry over you?
Why should I cry cry cry over you?
I keep on thinking about you
I’ve got no private pride to hide
I’ve built my world around you
Like a call without reply
My love has lost direction
She’s got the sun in her eyes
Why should I cry over you?
Why should I cry cry cry over you?
Hearing your footsteps
Loud on my stairs
A walking…
Living without you
Feeling the sweet sweet smell of love in the air
I can feel it
Living without you
Kissing the face that I see everywhere
But I’m living without you
Living without
