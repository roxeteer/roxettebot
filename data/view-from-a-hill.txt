Raging waves sweep this heavy heart
Cold is the colour of the dark
Find a byway and climb that hill
Watch the thunder cast a spell
What did you gain from love?
Don’t ask me!
All for the sweetest thrill…
I see a view from a hill
Oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill
Oh oh view from a hill
And it’s only a moment away
Love is a rainfall
Hard on the head
No escape though you’re soaking wet
Leave me blinded by your light
Leave me stranded alone tonight
What did you gain from love?
Don’t ask me!
All for the cheapest thrill…
I see a view from a hill
Oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill
Oh oh view from a hill
And it’s only a motion away
