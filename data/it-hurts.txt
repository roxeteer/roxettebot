Can you tell me where it leaves
When it’s neverending?
Can you tell me where to go
When no one’s home?
And I know you know
It hurts
It hurts to be alone
You’re on your own
On the one-way train going down
Can you tell me what to say
When there’s no one listening?
Can you show me what to do
When all is done?
I know you know
It hurts
It hurts to be alone
The plan has gone wrong
Like a runaway train going down
Going down, down, down
Going down
Going down, down, down
Oooohhhh
Yes I know you know
It hurts
It hurts to be alone
You’re on
On your own
On a one-way train going down
Going down
Going down, down, down
Going down
Going down, down, down
That’s the feeling
It hurts to be alone…
Going down
