In the coldest time of year
Darkness all around my heart
I was alone but didn’t fear to wander
In the light of the stars
In the bright and silent night
Winds would knock and disappear
Still I felt the feeling near
Like the first time you were ever here
You’re so far away
So far away
You left me
You told me you would stay
You never said goodbye and
I’ll keep asking how
Oh come unto me now
I have breathed the morning air
I have heard the four winds blow
I was weary but prepared to follow
Down this lonely road
In the room where lovers sleep
Winds would knock and disappear
Still I felt the music near
Like the first time we were ever here
You’re so far away
So far away
You left me
You told me you would stay
You never said goodbye and
I keep wondering why
I keep on wondering how
Oh come unto me now
You’re so far away
So far away
You left me
You told me you would stay
You never said goodbye and
I keep wondering why
I keep on wondering how
Oh come inside me now
