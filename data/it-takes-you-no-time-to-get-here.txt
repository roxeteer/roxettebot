Why don’t you take the rest of the day off
You do deserve a break
Follow that road
It ain’t long
Just cross that silver lake
Yea pass the pond
The off-white fence
When you see the mailbox to the left
You’ve made it all right
No way to go wrong
All you do is blow that horn
It takes you no time to get here
Just drive out of town today
It takes you no time to get here and when
You’ve arrived you might as well stay
You might as well stay
Why don’t you leave your desk for a short while
You do deserve some time
Enjoying the other side of life
You forgot to memorize
Stay in the sun
Reach for the moon
Make a little love in the afternoon
You’re doing all right
No way you go wrong
This is the place where you belong
It takes you no time
No time to get here
