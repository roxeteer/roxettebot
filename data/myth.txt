You were born with a one-story mind
In a one-story town
With sleepy Mondays all around
But you never slipped, no baby, you held tight
Your peppermint teeth flashed in the night
You always made the wrong words sound all right
I love your myth
I love what they say about you, yea
I love all the things
All the things that you do
The talk of the town, the stories about you, yea
Cream tangerine, baby I love your myth
I’ve got this urge comin’ on so strong
Oh I want to take you home
I’ve got to, I’ve got to take you home
I’m feelin’ like a monkey hangin’ in a tree
I love when you pay attention to me
I want to read your steamy poetry
I love your myth
I love what they say about you, yea
I love every little thing
Every little thing that you do
The talk of the town, the stories about you, yea
Cream tangerine, baby I love your myth
I’ve got this feeling comin’ on so strong
I have to take you home tonight
I’ve got to take you
You never slip you always hold on tight
You make the wrong moves look all right
You make it all all right
Baby, I love your myth
I love your myth
I love what they say about you, yea
Sweet tangerine, baby I love you
I love your myth
I love what they say about you, yea
I love every little thing
Every little thing that you do
The talk of the town, the stories about you, yea
Cream tangerine, baby I love your myth
