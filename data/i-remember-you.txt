Are you ready? go!
I hear your footsteps like you’re walking
I hear your voice like you’re talking to me
And I can reach every moment
Every caress like i’m living a dream
Down to the bone
Go little darling
Oh I remember you
Feels like it was yesterday
I remember you
You’ve got me running back again
You shared my secrets and my laughter
I fell in love with the light in your eyes
And I believed that summer would go on and on
For the rest of my life
Down to the bone
Go little darling
Hey I remember you
Feels like it was yesterday
I remember you
You’ve got me running back again
You’ve got me running
I say: na na na na na na na na na na
