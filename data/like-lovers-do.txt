Take the line between us and hold it close to you
I want us to get together like lovers do
Let me kiss away your troubles the cold and lonely nights
Just take this heart I’m giving and love is on the rise
Like lovers do – want to hold you through the night
Like lovers do – and when I look into your eyes
Like lovers do – oh I’m drowning in an ocean of emotion
It feels just like forever since I made love to you
September days of scarlet April morning dew
So take the love between us and hold it close to you
I want us to get together like lovers do
Like lovers do – want to hold you through the night
Like lovers do – and when I look into your eyes
Like lovers do – oh I’m drowning in an ocean of emotion
Like lovers do – want to hold you through the night
Like lovers do – and when I look into your eyes
Like lovers do – oh I’m drowning in an ocean of emotion
Like lovers do – want to hold you through the night
Like lovers do – and when I look into your eyes
Like lovers do – oh I’m drowning in an ocean of emotion
Like lovers do – want to hold you through the night
Like lovers do – and when I look into your eyes
Like lovers do – oh I’m drowning in an ocean of emotion
