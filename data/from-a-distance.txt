Even if you spend time
I'm hard to find, in line
No tears for me
No hint of sadness inside
Though I'm angry, lonely
Got no life to live
And I'm hungry, thirsty
For all love can give
But I, won't show you any sign
Everything looks fine
From a distance
I wish I could close
And clear my eyes and mind
I'm running blind
Into the wilderness tonight
And it's scary, lonely
It's no way to live
And I'm hungry, thirsty
For all love can give
But I, won't show you any sign
Everything looks fine
From a distance
No I, I won't reveal any sign
Everything looks perfectly fine
From a distance
Oh, from a distance
Oh, from a distance
From a distance
From a distance
From a distance
