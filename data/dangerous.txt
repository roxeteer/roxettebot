You pack your bag
You take control
You’re moving into my heart and into my soul
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I won’t be walking on thin ice
To get through the night
Hey, where’s your work?
What’s your game?
I know your business but I don’t know your name…
Hold on tight
You know she a little bit dangerous
She’s got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she’s a little bit dangerous
You turn around
So hot and dry
You’re hiding under a halo
Your mouth is alive
Get out of my way!
Get out of my sight!
I’m not attracted to go deeper tonight
Hey, what’s your word?
What’s your game?
I know your business but I don’t know your name…
Hold on tight
You know she a little bit dangerous
She’s got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she’s a little bit dangerous
She’s armed and extremely dangerous…
