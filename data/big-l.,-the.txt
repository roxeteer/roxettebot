She’s the top she’s got the world on a string
She makes me boogie makes me do anything yea yea
Hey now touch the sky
You’ve got a certain kind of look in your eyes
Well she’s a miracle she’s all that I need
Like the water and the air that I breathe yea yea
Hey now reach the sky
There’s a certain kind of look in your smile
And I know what love can do
Yes I know what hearts can do
The big love is taking the wheel
The big love goes head over heels
The big lust bring it into a small world
The bigger the better
Big love waiting to catch the big one
Head over heels
The big one bring it into the small world
I’m building the big big love
I’m building the big big love
It’s kinda strange a bit mysterious
I got to take it oh so so serious
Hey now touch the sky
You’ve got a certain kind of look in your eyes
It used to be so hard so lonely at night;
Well she’s my baby and I’m feeling alright
Hey now move the sky
There’s a certain kind of look in that smile
When I’m making love with her
When I’m making love to her yea
The big love is taking the wheel
The big love goes head over heels
The big lust; bring it into a small world
The bigger; the better
Big love; waiting to catch the big one
Head over heels
The big one; bring it into the small world
I’m building the big big love
I’m building the big big love
It has to be a big thing
It’s bringing me to my knees
Has to be a big thing big thing
Ya know what I’m saying…
