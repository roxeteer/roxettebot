Turn to me
When your heart breaks away
Turn to me
Don’t turn me away
When everything’s said and done
When you’re looking for somewhere to run
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Turn to me
When the moon gets too cold
Turn to me
When the story’s been told
When everything’s dim and grey
When you’ve hidden the rainbow away
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Now that Christmas is here
I’ll shatter your fears
And if you want the secrets of mine
Turn to me and read these lonely lonely eyes
Why don’t you
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Why don’t you turn to me?
Rely on me
Why don’t you turn to me?
Turn to me
Why don’t you
Why don’t you turn to me?
Now that Christmas is here
Rely on me
Why don’t you turn to me?
Now that Christmas is here
Turn to me
