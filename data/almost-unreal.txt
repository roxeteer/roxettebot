Babe, come in from the cold
And put that coat to rest
Step inside
Take a deep breath
And do what you do best
Yea, kick off them shoes
And leave those city streets
I do believe love came our way
And fate did arrange for us to meet
I love when you do that hocus pocus to me
The way that you touch
You’ve got the power to heal
You give me that look
It’s almost unreal
It’s almost unreal
Hey, we can’t stop the rain
Let’s find a place by the fire
Sometimes I feel
Strange as it seems
You’ve been in my dreams all my life
I love when you do that hocus pocus to me
The way that you touch
You’ve got the power to heal
You give me that look
It’s almost unreal
It’s almost unreal
It’s a crazy world out there
Let’s hope our prayers are in good hands tonight
