I know her and every notion I get from her I wear inside me
I know her all of the broken leaves of love she leaves behind
Oh – don’t you hide away from the rain
Oh – can you tell me the name of this game?
I got to get thru to you
Behind the door
Another wall
A lonely cry
A call of the wild
A dancing daze
An empty face
A crystal high
A call of the wild
And there is something that sweeps the dark
A lover’s dart
The call of a broken heart
Wrapped in the night
Behind these eyes
Oh hear the cry
The call of the wild
I know her and in my mind I dream of her
How she aches without me
I know her and every heart is a lonely number when she walks by
Oh – can you read the hurt in my eyes?
Oh – don’t you leave without saying goodbye
I got to get thru to you
Behind the door
Another wall
A lonely cry
A call of the wild
A dancing daze
An empty face
A crystal high
A call of the wild
And there is something that sweeps the dark
A lover’s dart
The call of a broken heart
Wrapped in the night
Behind these eyes
Oh hear the cry
The call of the wild
