Running running from one heart to another
Running running from one heart to another
Echoes of loneliness
Traces from love affairs will never disappear
Always come thru
I thought I’d never know the time to see you go
Two people turned into one
Thinking as one
A hint in the night
A touch of a dream has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
The rose of our love is withered and torn
And gone from one heart to another
Sailing away to sea
The ships made of you and me
They pass in the darkest nights
And turn out the lights
And I thought I’d never know the season to see you go
Two people twirled into one
Being as one
A hint in the night
A touch of a dream has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
The rose of our love is withered and torn
And gone from one heart to another
Running running from one heart to another
A hint in the night
A touch of a dream has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
The rose of our love is withered and torn
And gone from one heart to another again
A touch of a dream has come to an end
We run from one heart to another again
The rose of our love is withered and torn
And gone from one heart to another again
Running running from one heart to another
Running running from one heart to another
