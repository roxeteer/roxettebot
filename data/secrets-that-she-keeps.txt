I move all right
I got the wheels going ’round
Making ways in the night
Yea we’re movin’ all right
Wipin’ the rain from the ground
And the pale from the sky but something happens
In his heart when the morning comes
The secrets that she keeps away from me
The tears on the pillow she don’t want me to see
Well every little thing she does is for me
But somebody new is breaking us in two
He’s the kind of love that makes a whirl in your mind
Like the tide and the time
With just a little bit o’soul
He fights to find peace of mind
In these shattering eyes
But something happens
In his heart when the morning comes
The secrets that she keeps away from me
The tears on the pillow she don’t want me to see
Well every little thing she does is for me
But somebody new is breaking us in two
The secrets that she keeps away from me
The tears on the pillow she don’t want me to see
Well every little thing she does is for me
But somebody new is breaking us in two
The secrets that she keeps away from me
The love of you and me
