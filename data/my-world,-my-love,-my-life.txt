Some days are covered in rain
While other days are made for glory
And you are the summer sun
The only one who knows the story
Do you want to talk about it? – I don’t know
Do you want to say some words? – Oh I can’t let go
I’m talking about my world my love my life
Every time I try to close my eyes
You just enter my mind
And you lay yourself down beside me… oh why?
Some streets are covered with sweat
There are no regrets just new connections… oh why?
You are the Summer Son and i’m the one who wants affection
Do you want to talk about it? – I don’t know
Do you want to speak some words? – Oh I can’t let go
I’m talking about my world my love my life
Every time I try to close my eyes
You just run through my head
And you lay yourself down, beside me… oh why?
My world my life…
I’m talking about my world my love my life
Every time… I try to close my eyes
You just enter my mind
And you lay yourself down beside me… oh why…
You just run through my head
And you lay yourself down beside me… oh why…
