I don’t know much about you
But I’m pretty sure I wanna be with you
I haven’t got a clue what is wrong
What is right
What is left to do
I read a magazine
I watch TV-screen
I dive into a dream only to find me in love with you
I wish you’ll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop p-pop pop pop pop every time you’re around
It’s a pleasant valley Sunday
And everything seems to be beautiful
People go to church
But I’m found contemplating by the swimmingpool
I’m gazing at the sun
I watch him bringing joy to everyone
I feed the ducks with a bun only to find me in
Love with you
I wish you’ll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop
You make my head go pop pop p-pop pop pop pop ever time
You’re around
Press to play and never stop to make my head
Go pop
Yea you make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop
Every time you’re around
Make my head go pop pop pop
Make my head go pop pop
Go pop pop
I feed the ducks with a bun only to find me in love with you
