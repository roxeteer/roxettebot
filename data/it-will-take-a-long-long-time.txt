Sunny called
I was in the hall
And made a note
I have to paint the kitchen walls
An angel smiled across the room
All in all it was a lazy afternoon
Then I thought about you
I think it was some sweet song that I heard
Got to get goin’ goin’ ahead
It will take a long, long time
Got to go ahead and deal with my life
It has taken such a long time this time
Sunny called
I was in the bath
And heard the rain hit the roof and tiles
Real hard (hit the roof real hard/hit the roof)
Then I ran through my magazines
A few letters poorly hidden in a jar
(hidden in a jar/oh what a jar!)
And I thought about you
It must have been some old pictures I found
Got to get goin’ goin’ ahead
It will take a long, long time, yea yea
Got to go ahead and deal with my life
It has taken such a long time this time
Inganakee leo yo
Inganakee leo
