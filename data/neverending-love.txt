Chasing your shadow
The senses together
Four-leafed and clever
I come from behind
Chasing your shadow
I wander in circles
You’re 1 in a million
We’re 2 of a kind
It’s you that I long for
It’s you that I hunger
Oh you are the maker
Of waves in my mind
We dance in the moonlight
A run on the wire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
The fever turns slowly
Into a fire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
Chasing your shadow
Moon and the water
Field and the reaper
Star and the sky
Chasing your shadow
Hammer and heartbeat
Clay and new concrete
I follow the signs
It’s you that I long for
It’s you that I hunger
And you are the maker
Of waves in my mind
We dance in the moonlight
A run on the wire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
The fever turns slowly
Into a fire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
We dance in the moonlight
A run on the wire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
The fever turns slowly
Into a fire
Drawing a fine line
A neverending love
