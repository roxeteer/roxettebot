There’s a hidden meaning in everything she says
Every close encounter
Every kiss
Every caress
Even the truth has got that bitter taste of a lie
Well, I can read this lips but I can’t read his mind
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh – oh oh oh
He was one of the kind that seems so hard to find
There’s a change of weather
Now he leaves me far behind
That I don’t matter to him came as such a surprise
Well, I can read his lips
I thought I red his eyes
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh – oh oh oh
I can see him dance away now
Oh oh – oh oh oh
