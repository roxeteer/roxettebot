Hey now honey you got to face the floor
You headed for the heart
But you couldn’t find the door
Could you? Could you?
Well I’m standing in the sun
But I’m living in the rain
I got to get a-whirlin’
Like a human hurricane over you over you
Now you’re looking like a fox on the run
And you’re faster than a shot from a gun
I’m pointing at you oh you
Talking ’bout you hey you
I thought we had love in store
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Babe I’ve seen it all before
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Ain’t no lovin’ you ignore
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Keep keep knock knockin’ on every door
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Hey now honey time is all you’ve spent
You moved into the bed
But you couldn’t pay the rent
Could you?
In the twinkle of an eye you electrify
I got to get a-shootin’ like a rocket in the sky
Bye bye goodbye
Now you’re burning like you’re hot on the scene
Don’t you love to steal a part of my dream?
I’m looking at you oh you
Talking ’bout you yea you
I thought we had love in store
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Babe I’ve seen it all before
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Ain’t no sugar you ignore
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Keep keep knock knockin’ on every door
I thought we used to have love in store
- you keep knock knockin’ on every door
Hey babe don’t run around here no more
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Ain’t no sugar you ignore
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
Keep keep knock knockin’ on every door
- you keep on knockin’ on every door
You’d better learn your lesson now…
