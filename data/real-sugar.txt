Right at the front door
I recognized the perfume
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon
There must be many ways
To ask her to my room
Why didn’t I dare?
Well every hour
I try to get somethin’ done
Out on the weekend
When I’m just havin’ some fun
I’m windin’ up with none
Just zeroes, no 1′s
Just space with no air
I get: “Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye…”
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb the walls
Real sugar
That’s what I want or none at all
Real sugar
Sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar
That’s what I want and what I need
That’s what I need
Yeah every Friday
I’m gettin’ ready to roll
I want her blue eyes start sayin’ “Hi” and “Hello”
But I can always tell she’d rather be alone
With some other guy
I get: “Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye…”
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb no walls
Real sugar
That’s what I want or none at all
Real sugar
Sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar
That’s what I want and what I need
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb the walls
Real sugar
That’s what I want or none at all
Real sugar
Sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar
That’s what you’ve got so what’s for me?
Hey what’s for me?
I turn myself in turn turn turn
I turn myself out outside and in
I turn myself in turn turn turn
I turn myself out outside and in
Real sugar real sugar
I get: “Bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye…”
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb no walls
Real sugar
That’s what I want or none at all
Real sugar
Sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar
That’s what I want and what I need
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb the walls
Real sugar
That’s what I want or none at all
Real sugar
Sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar
That’s what you’ve got so what’s for me?
Gimme gimme real sugar
Gimme gimme real sugar
Real sugar
I don’t wanna climb no walls
