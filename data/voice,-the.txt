Between the open heart
And the whisper goodbye
There’s a perfect teardrop in your eye
Between the lover’s moon
And the trembling sky
There’s a broken dream in your mind
And the voice is carrying
The love you have lost
And the change of heart
In someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying
The love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
Between the careful touch
And the breakaway kiss
There’s a beauty you can’t resist
Mmm between the fall apart
And the moment of bliss
There must be something more than this
And the voice is carrying
The love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying
The love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice
In the dark
In the dark
Hear the lonely voice
Hear the lonely voice
And the voice is carrying
The love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart
In someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying
The love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
Oh yea the voice is carrying
The love you have lost
Love you have lost
And the change of heart in someone you trust
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars
Love and the scars
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
In the dark
Lonely voice
Lonely voice in the dark
Hear the lonely voice
Hear the lonely voice in the dark
