I came in crawling
With an absent-minded smile
I had so many things untied that summer night
When I decided it was worth another try
Entering your heart.. ohh yeah
The clock turned seven
It was cold and damp outside
But sort of strange considering
It was July
But it helped convincing me I had, I had to to try
Entering your heart…
Close your eyes
Don’t say a word
All your thoughts must go unheard
And I…
Have failed so many times…
Entering your mind…
Entering your mind…
I’m not the most important one under the sun
I don’t have any power connections to the Pentagon
But I’ve got something of my own
That must get done
Entering you heart
Ohhh… entering your heart
Close your eyes
Don’t tell a soul…
All you dreams must be told…
And I…
Have failed so many times…
Entering you mind…
Entering you mind
Ohhh…
Ohhh…
I…
Have failed so many times…
Entering your mind…
Entering your mind…
Ohhh… entering you heart
Woah… entering you heart
