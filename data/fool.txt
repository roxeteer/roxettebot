I was alone
I told my mouth to shot up
Cos I was talking to myself
Like I always do when I’m stuck
Well, I was crying
You could be crying too
I was screaming throungh the windown
I keep missing you
And the tears came down from the sky
And the rain feel hard on my eyes
Now you know what I look like
I’m feeling like a fool
I lose on my own
I’m going back to school
And I will pray
Hallelujan
You’ll be breaking every rule
And come back to stay
I’m feeling like a fool
I really tried so hard to design my life
There’s a big black void in head
Like it’s been cut by a knife
Every time your name comes around
This stupidity follows me down
Now you know what I look like
I’m feeling like a fool
I thought I could swim I’m drowning in the pool
And I will pray
Hallelujan
You’ll be breaking every rule
And consider to stay
I’m feeling like a fool
Please come back to stay
I’m feeling like a fool
I’m feeling like a fool in my heart
I’m feeling like a fool
