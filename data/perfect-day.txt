Breathe some faith into my chest
Lay me down i need the rest
Ever since the sky turned grey
I’ve waited for the perfect day
Hey now
- it seems you’ve always touched me
Like the sun
There’s no escape for the broken-hearted
There’s no return once you’ve lost your way
I say a prayer now our love’s departed
That you’ll come back to stay
And bring the perfect day
Blinded by a crazy light
I fell into the darkest night
Those magic ties the two of us
I couldn’t see it turn to dust
Hey now
- it seems you’ve always reached me
Like the sun
There’s no escape for the broken-hearted
There’s no return once you’ve lost your way
I say a prayer now your love’s departed
That you’ll come back to stay
Bring back the perfect day
