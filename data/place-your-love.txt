Sunday sick o' my tears
Monday morning I could've felt much better
Tuesday you're in my way
I wish you would type my heart a letter
Place your love in my world
It's for you, it's made for you
I need time , a lot o' time
To get you off my mind
To get you off my mind
Wednesday, nothing's OK
Thursday afternoon I wish I was sleepin'
Friday and Saturday sun
Gettin' up early but I can't get nothing done
Place your love in my world
It's for you, it's made for you
I need time (I need time), a lot o' time
To get you off my mind
To get you off my mind, yeah
Maybe you'll come here
Maybe you'll disappear
Maybe the clouds I fear will turn to flowers in the air
These cool vibrations, they're hitting me all the time
You've got me diggin' and divin' in the garden of my mind
(Of my mind)
Friday and Saturday sun
Place your love (place your love) in my world
It's for you, it's made for you
I need time (I need time), a lot o' time
To get you off my mind
It's a high (it's a high) to watch you fly
Across the sky all the time
To watch you all the time
