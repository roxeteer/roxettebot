Save a prayer for a sinner and a saint
My baby’s coming back
Say a prayer
Hide hide away yea baby’s coming back
Hey hey hey ain’t gonna trouble his wandering mind
Gonna take on the time to find out
If my love is
Soul deep – spinning the heart round a wire
Soul deep – a heavenly wave
Soul deep – heating the heart like a fire
Soul deep is taking my breath away-ay-ay
Save a tear till the curtain will fall
Well I’m saving them all for you
Knock on wood
Is it understood that I’m saving it up for you
Hey hey hey
Love is a hustle just a moment behind
Gonna walk on the line to find out
If my love is soul deep…
Save a prayer for a sinner and a saint
My baby’s coming back
Say a prayer
Hide hide away yea yea baby’s coming back
Hey hey hey
Ride on the soul train
Now I’m too close to hide
Gonna take on the time to find out
If my love is soul deep…
