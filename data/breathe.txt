I’ve got to come down
I’ve been awake for far too long
My eyes look torn
They were so strong
I wore the crown
I wrote the song
Now it’s fading
My heart was open like a window to a summer breeze
I breathed your love
I filled my lungs and veins
And I breathed your love until I felt the pain
And like rain it slipped away
I tried to find out what love was really all about
Behind the curtain waits the sky
It’s rare I feel enough to cry
I’m drying up inside
My life was open like a window to the summer breeze
I breathed your love
I filled my lungs and veins
And U breathed your love until I met the pain
And like rain it slipped away
Just like a little rain
I breathed your love and nothing stayed the same
Yes I breathed your love and filled my heart in vain
Cuz like rain it slipped away
Just like rain it swept away
