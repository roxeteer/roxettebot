When I go to heaven
Harley Harley heaven
I want to meet a King
Like the Panhead 48
I want to meet the Fat One
We can talk for hours
When my time has come, babe
I won’t be running late
Flying high
Riders in the sky
Na na na na
When I go to heaven
I want to meet the Chiefs
Yea, I want to meet all Scouts
I won’t miss my friends
Cos I know where they’ll be
We’re all part of the Indian Family
Flying high
Riders in the sky
Na na na na
It’s alright, baby
I’m OK, honey
I’m only travellin’ thru this state of mine
Hey it’s alright, mama
I’m doin’ fine now, mama
I’m only in a certain state of mind
When I go to heaven
Hog hog heaven
I’ll have a drink with Elvis
While Marlon’s on his way
We’re kickin’ and we’re revvin’
We’re dressing up in style
It’s time to take a ride
On that freeway in the sky
Flying high
Riders in the sky
Na na na na
Come on, come on
