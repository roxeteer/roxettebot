You’re startin’ the trip
Where sugar’s so sweet
You’re pullin’ a face
And pushin’ your feet
Chillin’ is easy
You hide in the beat
But you’re a loner
If you want to say hello
If you want to talk real slow
Why dontcha phone her?
If you want the ice to glow
If you want the stars to show
Why dontcha call her?
Pullin’ the break
Is a stupid mistake
Time is right now
Gotta take what you make
No finger in the cake
When your body’s a quake
Can overthrow ya
If you want to say hello
If you want to talk real slow
Why dontcha phone her?
If you want the high to grow
If you’ve seen a UFO
Why dontcha call her?
If you want to see the light
If you want to dance all night
Why dontcha phone her?
If you want to touch the sun
If you want to join the fun
Why dontcha phone her?
If you want the high to grow
If you’ve seen a UFO
Why dontcha call her?
