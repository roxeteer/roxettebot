Never looked back on a love affair
I never spent minutes on history
It made me sad
It made me so sad
And in no time no time at all a change has begun
And the name is You
I feel strange
You’ve made my life strange
Cos baby when you get close to me
I say there’s a certain chemistry
Come back before you leave
I haven’t got room for a broken heart
Come back before you leave
You shouldn’t go at all
You shouldn’t go at all
So many years and so many nights
I still can recall oh
The way that you move when you dance
Do you want to dance?
We’ve had our habits and attitudes
You make me remember the power when everything’s right
Please stay the night
Cos baby when you get close to me
There’s something about you I really need
Come back before you leave
I haven’t got room for a broken heart
Come back before you leave
You shouldn’t go at all
You shouldn’t go at all
Babe, come back before you leave
I’ll be the air for you when you breathe
I’ll be the rising sun
Close the door, let’s make love
All God’s angels sing above
Into the rising sun
