What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in pain? Tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
You wear them so well those innocent eyes
You’re puttin’ on a wonderful disguise
I want you so bad. I’m pushing my luck
It feels like being hit by a truck
This is no place special. Don’t know why I came
If someone has a minute won’t you explain
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in pain? Tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
Na nana nana na
Na nana nana na
Being with you; dealing with fire
Oh won’t you come around (come out)
Come out (today) and play
(I want you so bad)
Answer my calls
Let’s spend the night within these walls
This is no place special
Nothing for the saying (Nothing for the saying)
If someone’s got minute; do please explain
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in vain? Tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
Na nana nana na
Na nana nana na
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in vain? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in vain? Tell me
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
Na nana nana na
Na nana nana na
What am I gonna to do
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in vain?
The centre of my heart
Yeah yeah yeah
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
What am I gonna do now?
What am I gonna say when I find the centre of my heart
Is a suburb to the brain?
