Goodbye to you
Goodbye to broken hearts
Goodbye to romance
Hiding in the dark
Nights that leave a scar
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to empty cards
Goodbye to this ball of bliss
I’m dancing from your arms
And I fill the bedroom with silent visions of rain
And I paint the morning with echoes from pleasure in pain
I don’t want to touch emotions
I just got to run away
Electric blue like oceans
Wild like lover sway
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to broken hearts
Goodbye to romance
Hiding in the dark
Nights that leave a scar
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to empty cards
Goodbye to this ball of bliss
I’m dancing from your arms
And I seal the pillow and shatter dreams down the hall
And I hag the heartache like pictures on the wall
Can you hear the sound of angels playing hurting games?
Well, I’m a stranger when I’m leaving
I was a stranger when I came
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to broken hearts
Goodbye to romance
Hiding in the dark
Nights that leave a scar
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to empty cards
Goodbye to this ball of bliss
I’m dancing from your arms
