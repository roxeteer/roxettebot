If you had one wish
What would it be?
If you had one wish
Would it be about me?
Just one wish
Could it be about me?
You might make a wish
For money or peace
Yea, you’d make a wish
For cosmic relief
Shade by the trees
Green summer leaves
Well, i was thinkin’ that
He-he-hey
Maybe one day
A wish of you and me
Yea, he-he-hey
Maybe one day
A wish of you and me
Please don’t tell me
What i don’t need to know
Please don’t offer
What i shouldn’t know
I don’t want to know
What doesn’t show
If you had one wish
What would it be?
If you had one wish
Would it be about me?
Just one wish
Could it be about me?
Cos i was thinkin’ that
He-he-hey
Maybe one day
A wish of you and me
Yea, he-he-hey
Maybe one day
A wish of you and me
Wavin’ high
Down below
Shine your light
Down here
