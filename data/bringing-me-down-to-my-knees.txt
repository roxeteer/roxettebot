Bringing me down to my knees
Been thinking about you
Without even trying
I’ve done it
There’s something about you
I can’t put my finger on it
Monday was fine
And I was on a high
Oh you thrilled me
I should be alright
But Friday I died when you killed me
You’re bringing me down to my knees, oh oh
Love me forever or baby
Just let it go, oh oh
I’m begging you please to ease
Allow your feelings to show; oh oh
You’re bringing me down to my knees ‘cos I love you so
If your love is strong
I want to be so sure about it
Oh is it all wrong to go on talking about it?
Monday was fine
Yea the hours went by like a summer breeze
But way down the line
You might make up your mind
And it’s time to freeze
You’re bringing me down to my knees, oh oh
Love me forever or baby
Just let it go, oh oh
I’m begging you please to ease
Allow your feelings to show, oh oh
You’re bringing me down to my knees ‘cos I love you so
Oh, you’re bringing me down to my knees ‘cos I love you so
Oh oh yeah
Bringing me down to my knees
Oh oh
Love me forever or baby
Just let me go, oh oh
I’m begging you please to ease
Allow your feelings to show, oh oh
Love me forever or baby
Just let it go, oh oh
I’m begging you please to ease
Allow your feelings to show
Oh, you’re bringing me down to my knees ‘cos I love you
I love you so
I’m begging you please to ease
Allow your feelings to show, oh oh
I’ve been thinking about you
I’ve been thinking about you, oh baby
And I love you
And I love you
