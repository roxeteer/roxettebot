Like a whisper in me
I feel the warm winds coming through
I want you…
I want you…
The empty streets all look the same
Take me home blue morning rain
I want you…
Calling pictures in my mind
When I wanna be with you
On this long distance line
How I wish that you would stay
I want you…
Remember what you told me
We always wind up all alone
Together…
As long as rivers will run
As long as I can see the sun
I want you…
Moving pictures in my mind
When I wanna be with you
Along this long distance line
How I wish that you would say
I want you!
When your nights are lonely
No, you’re not the only
Just waiting for another day
How I wish that you would say
How I wish that you would say
I want you!
For all the love in your eyes
For all the love that’s in your mind
I want you…
I want you…
