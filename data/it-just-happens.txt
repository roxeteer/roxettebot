(Ah, woo-hoo)
(Ah, woo-hoo)
Oh, it just happens
(Ah, woo-hoo)
Oh, it just happens
(Ah, woo-hoo)
It's a cabaret, taking over on a quiet lazy backseat day
And it's so beautiful
Like the sunshine on your balcony
Just yesterday
Don't underestimate
Your heart is never late
And love will always find a way
It just happens
You don't know what's going on
If it's new or if it's been there since long
If it's right or wrong
(Ah) you fall in love
(Ah) you fall in love
You don't have a say
Just let it slide and close your eyes and watch the passion play
Don't underestimate
Your heart can never wait
And love will always find a way
(Ah) you fall in love
It just happens
(Ah) you fall in love
Oh, it just happens, oh yeah
(Ah) you fall in love
(Ah) it just happens, happens, oh
You fall in love
Don't underestimate
Your heart can never wait
And love will always find a way
It just happens and you don't know what's going on
If it's new or if it's been there since long
If it's right or wrong
(Ah) you fall in love
Oh, it just happens
(Ah) you fall in love
It just happens, oh
(Ah) you fall in love
Oh, it just happens, happens
(Ah) you fall in love
(Whoa, ah) you fall in love, woo-who
(Ah) you fall in love
(Ah) you fall in love
Oh yeah, it just happens, happens, oh
(Whoa, ah) you fall in love
(Ah) you fall in love
