I’ve been up all night
You’ve been putting up a fight
Seems like nothing I say gets through
How did this old bed
Fit a world between me and you?
We said goodnight but the silence was so thick
You could cut it with a knife
We’ve hit a wall again
And there’s nothing I can do
You’re the one
Yea I’ve put all my trust in your hands
C’mon look in my eyes
Here I am,
Here I am
You don’t understand me
My baby
You don’t seem to know
That I need you so much
You don’t understand me
My feelings
The reason I’m breathing, my love
The mornin’ comes
And you’re reaching out for me
Just like everything’s the same
And I let myself believe
Things are gonna change
When you kiss my mouth
And you hold my body close
Do you wonder who’s inside?
Maybe there’s no way
We could feel each other’s pain
Tell me why
It gets harder to know where I stand
I guess loneliness found a new friend
Here I am
You don’t understand me
You don’t seem to get me
My baby
You don’t really see
That I live for your touch
You don’t understand me
My dreams or
The things I believe in, my love
You don’t understand me
Understand me
