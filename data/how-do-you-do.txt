I see you comb your hair
And gimme that grin
It’s making me spin now
Spinnin’ within
Before I melt like snow
I say hello
How do you do!
I love the way you undress now baby begin
Do you caress
Honey my heart’s in a mess
I love your blue-eyed voice
Like Tiny Tim shines thru
How do you do!
Well here we are crackin’ jokes in the corner of our mouths
And I feel like I’m laughing in a dream
If I was young I could wait outside your school
Cos your face is like the cover of a magazine
How do you do
Do you do
The things that you do
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you
To say bye bye bye?
I see you in that chair with perfect skin
Well how have you been baby
Livin’ in sin?
Hey I gona know
Did you say hello
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
And I feel like everything’s surreal
When I get old I will wait outside your house
Cos your hands have got the power meant to heal
How do you do
Do you do
The things that you do
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you
To say bye bye bye?
