You promised me it will last forever
You said there is no way you could die
Everything you ever told me was a bunch of lies
Hey mama back on the outside
You know that’s not where I belong, no
Every truth, everything I believed in has turned out wrong
It’s all bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart so many times
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart
It’s so clear when you scratch on the surface
Going deeper, deeper down
All I wanted was to make you happy
But baby, what’s that sound?
But baby what’s that sound?
It’s all bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart so many times
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart
You’ve broke my heart
You’ve broke my heart
All you ever cared for was to make you stronger
No one I have known has looked so weak
Oh
You never know
It’s so bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart so many times
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart so many times
A lot of bla bla bla bla bla
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
You broke my heart so many times
