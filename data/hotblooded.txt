You know I’m hotblooded baby…
Get on up and kick it
All the systems are ready to go
Well – are you ready or not?
Hey, I gotta know!
Baby – lay down the blues
And let those guitars bleed
I’m everything you wanted
I’m all you ever need
Cos I’m hotblooded
Hotblooded
I need your lovin’
I need your love so bad
Flash all the lights
I’ll be a camera tonight
I’ll snap the look on your face
When I’m squeezing you tight
Yea sisters o’ soul
We gotta burn this old house down
Keep on beatin’ those drums
Keep on pumpin’ up that sound
Yea yea yea yea yea
Hotblooded
I’m hotblooded
I need your lovin’
I need your love so bad
I’m hotblooded
Hotblooded
You gotta know it
I need a shot of love so bad
I stay up late where the night’s alive
No sleep at all
I work nine to five
It’s honey do that and honey do this:
“Can I call you home?”
“Can I call you home?”
“Can I call?” – you can call me miss…
