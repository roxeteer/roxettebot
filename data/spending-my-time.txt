What’s the time?
Seems it’s already morning
I see the sky it’s so beautiful and blue
The TV’s on
But the only thing showing is a picture of you
Oh I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit but the story’s too thin
I thank the Lord above
That you’re not here to see me
In this shape I’m in
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I’m spending my time
I try to call
But I don’t know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please
Is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I’m spending my time
Spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound of “Tears of a Clown”
A prayer gone blind
I’m spending my time
My friends keep telling me:
“Hey, life will go on
Time will make sure I get over you
This silly game of love -
You play, you win only to lose.”
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I’m spending my time
Spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound of “Tears of a Clown”
A prayer gone blind
I’m spending my time
