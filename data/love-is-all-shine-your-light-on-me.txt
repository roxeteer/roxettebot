Love is all
Love is all around you
Love is there in your laughter
In your hair
Love flows everywhere
Love is old
Love is older than you
But the light shining through
Makes me see
Your love is all new
Hey
Sha la la
Shine a light
Shine on me
Shine your light on me
Sha la la
Shine your light on me
Love is all
Love will always be The Law
And higher love radiates on us all
On us all
