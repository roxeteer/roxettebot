Everywhere I look I see her smile
Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong
It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart
She’s so vulnerable
Like china in my hands
She’s so vulnerable
And I don’t understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She’s all I’ve got
But she’s so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Days like these
No one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There’s nothing words can say
She’s coloured all the secrets of my soul
I’ve whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls
This vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart yea
She’s so vulnerable
Like china in my hands
She’s so vulnerable
And I don’t understand
I could never hurt someone I love
She’s all I’ve got
But she’s so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Don’t hide your eyes…
