Wash my pain away,
Half a woman, half a shadow…
Daylight is breaking again
I hide in the dark. I’m watching the rain
You’re out of touch. You’re out of reach
What can I say, I never wanted it this way
Love sleeps all alone
The cold telephone I know the heart
Yes, I know the kind The kisses of fire
Turning to grey I never wanted it this way
I always wanted you to stay
Wash my pain away
Cause I’m half a woman half a shadow
Love always change with the trees
The spring and the leaves the waves on the sea
Wilder than light the wind in your eyes
Led me astray I never wanted it this way
I always wanted you to stay
Oh I need you yes I need you
Give me a reason to believe
