You took a ride to the other side
But I loved you
You took a flight in the middle of the night
But I loved you
You took a swim in an ocean of fools
I still loved you
You took a dream then you painted it blue
But I loved you
I thought you never would come back
I thought you never could come back
Oh no
Stay
Stay another day
I want you all the way
At home, at work, at play
Won’t you stay, make it easy, babe
Wait another day
Stay home, at work, at play
You tried to learn from history
You tried to kiss like a lover should
On the balcony
You took a dive where the fish was alive
But I loved you
You took my smile and it turned into a cry
But I loved you
I’d never suspect you of lookin’ back
I’d never expect you to come back
Oh no
Stay
Stay another day
I want you all the way
At home, at work, at play
Please stay, make it easy, babe
Wait another day
Stay home, at work, at play
Won’t you stay
Please stay
