I was raised the Northern way
And my father had a Northern name
I did my crying out in the pouring rain
And a season turned into another one
I found a heart bright like the morning sun
He touched my lips so softly with his fingertips
But I kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time
All the time
I kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time
All the time
And some things in life won’t ever change
There’s a smell of a rusty chain
And of love disappearing like an aeroplane
I’ve kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time
All the time
I’ve kept the rain
Falling down on me
All the time
All the time
