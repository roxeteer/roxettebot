Since you're all on a ship
With the wind, and the sun
Here it goes, just one night
'Cause you're not really sure
If you want to be alone
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
You've got something going on
Good karma
Since you're all in a room
On a kingsize bed, on your own
Oh, hold in close just for one night
'Cause you're not really sure
If you want me alone
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
You've got something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Since life was train passing by
But your heart is heaven on fire
Just when you thought you'd die here
You came up bright and so alive
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
You've got something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
You've got something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
There is something going on
Good karma
Come on and check
Check it, come on over
You've got something going on
Good karma
