Growing up on Cinnamon Street
Everywhere you look there are lots of people to meet
It’s seven o’clock
The breakfast treat
Now the schoolbus is here
Hurry up and grab a seat
All the dreams are tiny ones
Another week has just begun on Cinnamon Street
There was a girl on Cinnamon Street
The same age as me
We shared the curiosity
I won her heart cos I could play guitar
She promised me heaven at once and later all the stars
But it all remained the same
Cos things can never change on Cinnamon Street
I can hear my heartbeat
The very first time we made love
Life was a lazy rest in the sun
Later we went dancing
Staying up all night long
Playing all our favourite songs
Cinnamon songs
Oh oh na na na na na
I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street
Springtime is here and the air is so dry and sweet
I walk in a cloud
The smell of cinnamon bread
It’s in my blood since the day I was born ’til I wake up…dead
And the sun is smiling gently
A funny shade of red
Cinnamon Street
I still feel my heartbeat
The very first time we made love
Life was a lazy day in the sun
Later we went dancing
Hanging out all night long
Singing all our favourite songs
Cinnamon songs
Oh oh na na na na na
