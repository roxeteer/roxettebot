I knew this would happen
And I don’t want to be around
When it gets out
I’ve closed the last picture
And painted the window
Inside and out
Give me your dreams and I’ll give you my time
Together we’ll cross the borderline
Voices – cracking the night
Voices – that cut like a knife
Voices – hear them singing: Ooh ooh
From sparks to the fire
From here to obsession they cover the end
Twisting a match
And see the reflections of hunters of men
Give me your dreams and I’ll give you my time
Until we make it to the borderline
Voices – cracking the night
Voices – that cut like a knife
Voices – hear them singing: Ooh ooh
