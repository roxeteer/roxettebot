Here’s the house
Here’s the city and the stream
Here’s the father to my dream
Here’s the lost and lonely look in your eyes
When you leave
I will break down and cry
Sleeping single
I will wait for you
I’m sleeping single
’til you change your mind
Sleeping single
I will wait for you
’til time has gone by
I’ll pay the price
For all the love you poured like rain
“Toujours l’amour” over again
But the midnight chills are getting so rough
And the bed is big enough for both of us
Sleeping single
I would die for you
I’m sleeping single
Won’t you change your way
Sleeping single
I will pray for you to stay
He-hey … he-he-hey…
