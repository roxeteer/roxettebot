I’ve been hiding
I’ve been hiding
Lost in the love of another
I’ve followed the moon and a song
And I thought it would take me forever
To find a place where I belong
I watch a rainbow rise
I give you all I’ve got
I could never give you up
The way you make my love shine
I could never give you up
The way you make true love shine
I believe you when you say
You don’t want to be lonely
I’ll carry your heart like a bridge
When you need all the time you can find
To get the hurt out of your mind
I’ll watch the rain go by
And give you all I’ve got
Cause I could never give you up
The way you make my love shine
I could never give you up
The way you make true love shine
