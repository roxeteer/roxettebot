Everything here
Close to me
Is just the way
I want it to be
It’s all about faith
It’s all about trust
All about luck
And all about lust
My wish comes true
My wish comes true
I don’t mind showing for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything
Could have been night
Could have been day
Floating in space
I was drifting away
You’re making me warm
Making me high
I feel like laughing
Where i used to cry
My wish comes true
My dream comes true
I don’t mind showing for you
I reveal everything for you
Just about anything
