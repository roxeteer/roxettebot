Tell me why don't you bring me flowers?
Tell me why don't you notice me?
Another stranger on a train, a tip rock in the rain
In the rain, in the cold, cold rain
I will throw the past on the fire
I will sing you to sleep when you're tired
When the summer's turning small
I'll buy you a sweater for the fall
Warm and soft like the moonlight
But the now we part into reveal
The truth when we gathered living soul
Teach me how to breathe
Tell me why don't you bring me flowers?
Tell me why don't you notice me?
Another stranger on a train, a tip rock in the rain
In the rain, in the cold, cold rain
When the summer's turning small
Buy you a sweater for the fall
Warm and soft like the moonlight
