You wake me up in the middle of the night and burn the cover down
You’re on the phone, in the air, like a record try to spin me round
Oh won’t you move away oh honey get away
The joy of a toy – is it all that you came for?
The joy of a toy got the look of a lie
The joy of a toy put the hurt into action
The joy of a toy – you can kiss this love goodbye
How can you win when you don’t know a thing what love is all about?
Don’t want to fight so get out of my sight I won’t surrender now
It’s independence day oh honey get away
The joy of a toy – is it all that you came for?
The joy of a toy got the look of a lie
The joy of a toy put the hurt into action
The joy of a toy – you can kiss this love goodbye
Hello Goodbye
