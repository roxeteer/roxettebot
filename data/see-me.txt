With the moon and the sun in his eyes
He’s arrivin’
And I don’t know what I’d do without him
I’ve got life
Suddenly
See, see me
I’ve got nothing to hide
See me
I’ve got nothing to hide
See me
I’m leavin’ my heart
In the palm of his hand
So gently
I know he knows that I love him
Though I’ve never said
Is there an easy way?
See, see me
I’ve got nothing to hide
See me
I’ve got nothing to hide
See me
Comin’ home, I’m comin’ home
It feels like I’m comin’ home
Comin’ home, I’m comin’ home
See, (see me see me) see me
I’ve got nothing to hide (nothing to hide)
See me
I’ve got nothing to hide (nothing to hide)
See me…
