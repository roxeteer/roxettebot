Milk and toast and honey make it sunny
On a rainy Saturday he-he-hey
Milk and toast
Some coffee take the stuffiness
Out of days you hate you really hate
Slow morning news pass me by
I try not to analyse but didn’t he blow my mind this time
Didn’t he blow my mind?
Here he comes
To bring a little lovin’, honey
Here he comes
To take away the hurt inside
Here he comes
Is everything that matters to me
Here he comes
Is everything I want in life
Milk and toast and honey
Ain’t it funny how things sometimes look so clear
And feel so near
The dreams I dream my favorite wishful thinkin’
Oh he’s bookmarked everywhere everywhere
True love might fall from the sky
You never know what to find
But didn’t he blow my mind this time
Didn’t he blow my mind?
Milk and toast and honey
Here he comes
To bring a little lovin’ honey
To take away the pain inside
Here he comes
Is everything that matters to me
Here he comes
Is everything I want in life
Here he comes
Oh lay a little lovin’ honey
Here he comes
To feel you’re gettin’ close to me
Here he comes
Is everything that matters to me
Here he comes
Is everywhere I want to be
Here he comes
To bring a little lovin’ honey
Here he comes
To take away the pain inside
Here he comes
Is everything that matters to me
Here he comes
Is everything I want from life
Here he comes
Oh lay a little lovin’ baby baby
Here he comes
To gettin’ close to me
Here he comes
Is everything that matters to me
Here he comes
Is everywhere I want to be
To bring a little lovin’
Is everything I want
To lay a little lovin’
Is everything I want
Oh here he comes
