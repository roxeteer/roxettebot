We grew up together
We’ve been here forever
Barefoot in the summer
Cold in stormy wheather
She taught me all there is
Magic and love
Lots of forgotten words
But now
She doesn’t live here anymore
She’s off and she’s gone
She doesn’t live here anymore
I’m sorry that’s all
There is to it
I’m sorry that’s all
She dressed just like a painter
A female street Picasso
And I I will remember
The heaven in her laughter
And the scent of her sweet perfume
When we made love under an August moon
But now
She doesn’t live here anymore
She’s off and she’s gone
She doesn’t live here anymore
She’s gone since long so long
She doesn’t live here anymore
She took off and left home
She doesn’t live here anymore
I’m sorry that’s all
There is to it
I’m sorry that’s all
That’s all
