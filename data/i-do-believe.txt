Something woke me up
In the middle of the night
I never ever felt so lonely
I thought about givin’ you a call
But it was half past five
Got out of bed, walked thru the room
To the window
I saw 27 blocks still sleepin’
I thought about givin’ you a call
To get it off my mind
I do believe
When I close my eyes no one can see me
I do believe
When I close my eyes no one can see me
Some days
Are definitely better than others
Some got a flair so tragic
I wish you were here to be near
To help me thru the night
But then again
I got to carry on among the living
And leave these whirlwind battles behind me
Watchin’ you sleep
Only keeps on blurrin’ my sight
I do believe
When I close my eyes no one can see me
I do believe
When I close my eyes no one can see me
Who in this world would believe
Change will come eventually
To me
I long to get out in the sun
Out in the sun
Out in the rain
And wash these stains away
