My girl came home to me
Just the other day, acting OK
I was reading alone
In my favourite room, the TV was on
May I be excused
For not telling the truth
‘cos she’s gone, she said
She’s better off on her own
She turned her head
Much better off on her own
My girl knocked on the door
To the place I usually refer to as home
I died, shoelace untied
She looked in my eyes, small and surprised
And God closed every gaze
The moon fell into the lake
Boy, she’s gone, a drift
She’s better off on her own
She closed, then she left
Much better off on her own
Sitting naked by the windowsill
Watching cars upon the hill
Am I sleeping?
I was dreaming
For just a moment time stood still
Better off on her own
Better off on her own
Now she’s gone, she said
She’s better of on her own
She turned her head
Much better off on her own
She’s gone, she sighed
She’s better of on her own
The tears I cried
Much better off on her own
My girl came home to me just the other day
