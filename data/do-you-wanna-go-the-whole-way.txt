Before the take off all our clothes and get close together
Before it gets too serious both of us need to know
Are we gonna go the whole way this time?
Before all secrets are revealed old scars must heal or whither
But it’s getting very late and I can’t wait anymore
Are we gonna go the whole way this time?
Do you wanna go the whole way this time?
This time?
Do you wanna go the whole way now?
We’re taking it easy
Do you wanna go the whole way, babe?
Kick it in, kick it in slowly
Do you wanna go the whole way this time?
Do you wanna go the whole way for sure?
Do you wanna go the whole way this time?
This time?
This time?
Do ya?
