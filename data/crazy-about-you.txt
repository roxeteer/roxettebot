Ooooo…
I’m crazy about you
I’ll give you all my love
Yes I’m crazy about you
Night and day
Day and night
I’ll be your heart’s salvation
Hey baby let’s stay together
Let’s make it now and forever
I want to show it and shout it
And tell the whole world about it
I thought it never could happen
I thought you never would see me
You run a lovin’ locomotive
You make my needs very primitive
The more I get
The more I want from you
Of your affection
When you’re around
I’m in control
I feel a complete connection
Hello hello
I’m so crazy about you
You know… baby
Hello hello hello
Yes I’m crazy
So crazy about you
C’mon close your eyes
Honey trust me!
I want to enjoy your body
I want to take you much higher
And play the game of desire
Well I can’t hide
I’m getting hungry for a bite
I’m blinded by this obsession
I keep dancing like your possession
I’ll wrap my legs all around you
I’ll show you total devotion
No need to talk
Love will speak to you
With sweet emotions
Hello hello
I’m so crazy about you
You know…baby
Hello hello hello
Yes I’m crazy
So crazy about you
