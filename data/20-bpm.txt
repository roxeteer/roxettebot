You want the streets at midnight
You want to shine in dim light
Those walks are made for poets
Don't look like you don't know it
You want a soul survivor
You want a beauty parlour
A space to last forever
No blues can lose the colour
Oh baby don't you know
When things are getting slow
Make a crazy prediction
Melt the facts with the fiction
Underground with perfection
Baby make the connection
Another 20 bpm in your life
It's alright
You want the diamond clover
You want the bossa nova
You never end the sway
Until you won me over
You dream under the pillow
You write your name in silver
A wall is built for poets
Don't look like you don't know it
Baby don't you know
When things are getting slow
Make a crazy prediction
Melt the science with fiction
Underground with perfection
Baby make the connection
Another 20 bpm in your life
It's alright
Oh baby don't you know
When things are getting slow
Make a crazy prediction
Melt the facts with the fiction
Underground with perfection
Honey make the connection
Another 20 bpm in your life
It's alright
