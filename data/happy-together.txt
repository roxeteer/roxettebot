When she walked up, he walked down
Just like the seasons went round and round
She was in love, he wasn’t sure
She wrote some letters he tried to ignore
They could have been so happy together
They could have been so lucky in love
Sing la di da
So happy together
They could have run the earth, the sky, the sun
She carried his ring since she left school
He knew she was precious, the prettiest jewel
She wanted a baby, but he wasn’t sure
He couldn’t make up his mind anymore
They could have been so happy together
They could have been so lucky in love
Sing la di da
So happy together
They could have run the earth, the stars, the sun
I couldn’t ever hurt no one
If you feel shattered I’m sorry for what I’ve done
We could have been so happy together
We could have been so lucky in love
Sing la di da
So happy together
We could have run the earth, the sky, the sun
Yea, we could have been so happy together
We could have been so lucky in love
Sing la di da
So happy together
We could have run the universe
Could have run the universe
Could have run the universe for fun
So happy together
So happy together
So happy together
