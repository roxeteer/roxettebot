I left and wrote this song cos my life looked so shattered
I thank the Lord I’m still strong like before
I picked myself up from the floor and tried
I tried just a little bit harder oh yea
If someone wants you to bleed
And it feels like you’re dying
Don’t make the moves you don’t need
Don’t cry just say ba-ba-bye-bye and try try
Try just a little bit harder - you’ll survive
Try just a little bit harder - go ahead and try
Mondays and rainy days were in my pocket
I don’t want to send them on to you
Bring them to you
