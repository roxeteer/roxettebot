I heard your heart
You held it close to me
The wild embrace
The silent sea
A whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme
But now I’m lost in the crowd
No shadow of a doubt
It’s all over now
No shadow of a doubt
You changed the dream
You changed the scenery
The tender touch
The urge to breathe
There under a love-lit sun
What’s lost could be found
But now no trace of a sound
No shadow of a doubt
I’m far away bound
No shadow of a doubt
