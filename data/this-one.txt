Maybe I will, maybe I won't
I'm a midnight to six man
I'm damned if I don't
Oh, I'm still leaning on the record machine
Oh, give me a coin and I will kick off that dream
In 2016
This one's for you
This one
This one, this one, this one, this one
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
What doesn't kill you
Will make you so strong
Oh, I've been awaiting for the table to turn, hey
Oh, I wish I knew how, but now I'm starting to learn
You crash and I burn
This one's for you
This one
This one, this one, this one
This one's for you
It's for you
This one
This one, this one, this one, this one
Oh yeah
Ooh, wooh, ooh, wooh, ooh, wooh
Ooh, wooh, ooh, wooh, ooh, wooh
I'm still leaning on the record machine, hey, hey
Give me a coin and I will kick off that dream
In 2016
This one's for you
This one
This one, this one, this one (Oh, oh)
This one's for you
This one
This one, this one, this one
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
This one, this one, this one, this one
Oh, for you, oh, oh
This one, this one
